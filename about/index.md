When I was&nbsp;8, I got my first computer—Commodore&nbsp;64. Apart from playing
games, I used it to write my first programmes in BASIC and its more sophisticated
version—**Simons' BASIC**.

Since the beginning of PC era, I have gone a long way through different programming
languages.  I started with **Pascal**, which was excellent for learning. For most
assignments at the University, I used **C++**. Finally, **Java** became my
favourite language for many years.

I have never stopped learning though. I got particularly interested in functional
languages running on the JVM—**Scala** and **Kotlin**.

However, I believe that the language is not the most important aspect of
programming. As it is impossible for a single software developer to write
a whole programme, **clean code** is crucial for success of every project.
Moreover, since computers are widely used, not only by scientists, user
experience is essential for commercial success of the product.

**My goal is to create beautiful software that people like to use,
by writing beautiful code that programmers like to read.**
